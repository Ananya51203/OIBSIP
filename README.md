The Journey of web development Internship with 
Oasis infobyte has been completely packed with
Learning, Growth, Skill-building, Hands-on
experience and Professional growth. I am excited 
to share the reflections on my Internship tenure.

It was a month long internship. I started 
learning the basics of HTML,CSS,Java Script
for the first week and then started crafting 
websites. I completed 3 tasks of level one .

1.Landing page: created a landing page for a 
bakery highlighting its motto, a gallery to
showcase its art work and an input form to 
subscribe to its news letter.
2.Portfolio Website: Created a portfolio 
website using HTML,CSS,JavaScript 
and Bootstrap. This website showcases 
all my skills and projects in an organized way.
3.Temperature Converter: A basic Temperature
converter to convert temperature from
Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice-versa. 
The UI of the converter came out really well.

Conclusion: This Internship is a great learning
opportunity and will be a remarkable stone 
in my professional journey.
